    <h2 class="topic">Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>

            <li>500g Bramley apples or similar (cored and cut into 1-2 cm chunks)</li>
            <li>25g brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Crumble:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>160g of plain flour</li>
            <li>100g brown sugar</li>
            <li>100g cold butter</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
    <h2 class="topic">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C or 400°F (Gas mark 6).</li>
            <li>Core the apples and cut them into 1-2 cm chunks, leaving the skin on (apple peel is packed with nutrients). Mix the apples with 25g (2 tablespoons) of brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Transfer the spiced apples to a baking dish (mine is round, 23cm diameter) and arrange them in an even layer.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine 160g of plain flour and 100g of brown sugar with a pinch of salt. Mix well. Slice in 100g of cold butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles moist breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Pour the crumb mixture over the apples and even it out with a spoon or your hand. You can lightly drag the fork over the top for a decorative finish.</li>
            <li>Place it in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden, and the apples feel soft when you insert a toothpick or fork.</li>
            <li>Allow it to cool before serving. I recommend serving it warm with vanilla ice cream on top.</li>
        </ol>
